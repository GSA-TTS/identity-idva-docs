faqs:
  - question: Why is GSA doing this study?
    answer: <p>GSA is committed to combating bias. This research study will help us make sure government websites work for everyone.</p><p>To improve outreach practices, user testing, and user experience for underserved communities in civic tech design, we’re studying the equity of remote identity-proofing technologies that the American public may interact with when accessing eligible government services and benefits. </p><p>GSA plans to release a report with the results from the study in a peer-reviewed publication in 2024. The report will present a statistical analysis of the performance of proofing checks and explore the causes behind any negative or inconclusive results. Once the report is published on GSA.gov, GSA will use the results to inform requirements for future procurements and studies.</p>
  - question: What is remote identity proofing?
    answer: <p>Identity proofing is the process of verifying that an individual is who they say they are.</p><p>Government agencies, financial institutions, and other organizations often require some type of “proof” before granting you access to their services. This is typically done by asking you for documentation such as a driver’s license, a passport, or your Social Security Number.</p><p>Traditionally, organizations would take a hard copy of these items while in your presence and a person would physically attest that your documents actually belong to you. These processes help organizations catch people who may be pretending to be you.</p><p>Remote identity proofing uses modern technology to streamline this process. In this study, identity-proofing software will try to determine if two images of you belong to the same person. One image will be captured from a government-issued identification that has a picture of you on it, the other from a picture you take of yourself (a “selfie”). GSA will also verify the information you provide (i.e. Social Security Number, address, phone number, etc.) and compare it to data sources to ensure that it also matches.</p>
  - question: What do I need to participate in the study?
    answer: <p class="font-sans-lg margin-bottom-3"><strong>You will need:</strong></p><ul><li>a mobile phone with a camera feature;</li><li>a phone plan associated with your name (it cannot be a virtual phone number like Google Voice, VOIP, etc.);</li><li>a valid government-issued <a href="ROOTURL/faqs/#what-is-a-valid-id" class="usa-link">identity document</a>; and</li><li>your Social Security Number (SSN)</li></ul>
  - question: What is a valid ID?
    answer: <p>A valid ID is an unexpired government-issued identification card with a photo.</p><p>At this time, only the following IDs are accepted:</p><ul><li>Driver’s licenses from the 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and other US territories (Guam, US Virgin Islands, Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico)</li><li>Non-driver’s license state-issued ID card&#58; This is an identity document issued by the state, the District of Columbia (DC), or US territory that asserts identity but does not give driving privileges.</li></ul><p><strong>Notes:</strong></p><ul><li>Paper or temporary IDs are not accepted.</li><li>A worn or damaged picture may prevent the identity verification process from working.</li></ul>
  - question: Why do I need to provide my Social Security Number (SSN)?
    answer: Your SSN is used to verify your name, date of birth, and address against different records such as credit history reports.
  - question: Why are you asking for my skin tone?
    answer: <p>Research on facial verification systems has shown that results can vary significantly depending on a person’s skin tone. Although you are not required to provide your skin tone to complete the study, this information will help GSA better understand the challenges to equitable performance of facial verification algorithms.</p><p>See the following for more information&#58; </p><ul class="top-bullets"><li><a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://dam-prod2.media.mit.edu/x/2018/02/05/buolamwini-ms-17_WtMjoGY.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gender Shades&#58; Intersectional Phenotypic and Demographic Evaluation of Face Datasets and Gender Classifiers (Buolamwini, 2017) [PDF, 116 Pages]</a></li> <li><a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8280.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link usa-link--external">Face Recognition Vendor Test - Part 3&#58; Demographic Effects (NIST, 2019) [PDF, 82 Pages]</a></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11240" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link usa-link--external">Reliability and Validity of Image-Based and Self-Reported Skin Phenotype Metrics (Howard et al 2021)</a></li> <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9534882" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link usa-link--external">A Comprehensive Study on Face Recognition Biases Beyond Demographics (Terhörst et al., 2022)</a></li></ul>
