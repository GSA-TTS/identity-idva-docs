## What do I need to participate in the study?

<p class="margin-bottom-0">You will need:</p>
<ul class="alpha-list margin-top-1">
<li>a mobile phone with a camera feature;</li>
<li>a phone plan associated with your name (it cannot be a virtual phone number like Google Voice, VOIP, etc.);</li>
<li>a valid government-issued <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/faqs/#what-is-a-valid-id" class="usa-link">identity document</a>; and</li>
<li>your Social Security Number (SSN)</li>
</ul>

## How much time do I need to complete the study?

Generally, the study should take 15 to 45 minutes.


## Who is eligible to participate in study?

U.S. residents 18 years and older with a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/faqs/#what-is-a-valid-id" class="usa-link">valid government-issued identity document</a> are eligible to register for the study.

## Does this study meet accessibility requirements within 508 compliance? 

GSA recognizes that the “Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing'' may not be accessible to all potential participants with disabilities because it requires participants  to take photographs of their government-issued ID as well as a live “selfie” or headshot using functionality that may not be native to their device. GSA is investigating other remote identity proofing solutions that are designed to be more accessible and compliant with the requirements in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link usa-link--external">National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63</a>. 

## Why wasn’t I selected to participate?

You may be ineligible to participate if:

- you are under 18 years of age
- you do not agree to the terms and conditions of the study.
- you chose “prefer not to answer” in the required demographic questions
- the study has already reached the necessary number of participants from specific demographics.

## How does the study work?

<ol class="upper-alpha-list">
	<li>First, register for the study. As part of registration, you will be expected to:
		<ol class="lower-alpha-list">
			<li>Review the Rules of Use &amp; Privacy Act Statement, and accept the terms and conditions.</li>
			<li>Provide your first and last name and email address.</li>
			<li>You’ll then receive an email from <a href="mailto:identityequitystudy@research.gsa.gov">identityequitystudy@research.gsa.gov</a> with a link to proceed with the study.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>When you click on the link provided in the email, you will be directed to complete a demographic survey to determine whether you are eligible to participate. If so, you will be directed to proceed with the proofing process. If you are not eligible to participate, you will be notified and the information you provided up till then will be deleted. </li>
	<li>If you are eligible for the study, you will need to provide the following information:
		<ol class="numeric-list">
			<li>A valid government-issued identification (e.g., driver’s license, state ID)</li>
			<li>Your Social Security Number (SSN)</li>
			<li>Your phone number</li>
		</ol>	
	</li>
	<li>During this study, you will walk through these steps for identity proofing:
		<ol class="numeric-list">
			<li><strong>Document Authentication:</strong> You will capture images of your government issued identification document (ID) and a selfie. Because we will be testing FIVE different authentication systems, you will be asked to take a picture of your ID, and take a selfie, FIVE TIMES (once for each system).<br />The pictures of your ID will check for fraud-prevention markings like holograms, as well as the expiration date and barcode. The selfies help ensure that you are the same person that is pictured on your ID.</li>
			<li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Validation:</strong> - You will provide your phone number and SSN and confirm your first and last name, date of birth, and address. These items will be used to validate your personal information against consumer records like credit history and your phone account record.</li>
			<li><strong>Device Risk Check:</strong> The website scans your mobile device’s features and capabilities.</li>
			<li><strong>Security Code Check:</strong> You will receive and confirm a security code on your device (by phone call or text message).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>You will be directed to fill a short Exit Survey that is mandatory for study completion.</li>
	<li>You will receive an email with details regarding compensation.</li>
</ol>

## Why aren’t my pictures working?

During this study, you will be asked for at least five pictures of the front and back of your government-issued identification. Some of the ID verification tools will take the pictures automatically, and for others, we will ask you to take the picture yourself. The following tips will help you take better pictures: 
- Use a solid, dark background
- Show the edges of the ID in the photo
- Take a clear photo without shadows, glares, reflections or blur
- Check that barcodes are not damaged or dirty
- Take the photo in a well lit area with indirect light
- Turn off the flash on the camera

You will also be asked for at least five selfies. Again, some of these will be taken automatically, and for others, we’ll ask you to take the picture yourself. The following tips will help you take better pictures:
- Use a solid background. For example, avoid standing in front of a television if it’s turned on, because of the moving images in the background. However, if you turn the TV off, the solid dark background will likely work well
- Look straight at the camera 
- Take the photo in a well-lit area with indirect light
- Turn off the flash on the camera
