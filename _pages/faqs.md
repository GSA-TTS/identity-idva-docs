<h2 id="identity-proofing-and-the-study" class="anchor-headline">Identity Proofing &amp; The Study</h2>

### Why is GSA doing this study?

GSA is committed to combating bias. This research study will help us make sure government websites work for everyone. 

To improve outreach practices, user testing, and user experience for underserved communities in civic tech design, we’re studying the equity of remote identity-proofing technologies that the American public may interact with when accessing eligible government services and benefits. 

GSA plans to release a report with the results from the study in a peer-reviewed publication in 2024. The report will present a statistical analysis of the performance of proofing checks and explore the causes behind any negative or inconclusive results. Once the report is published on GSA.gov, GSA will use the results to inform requirements for future procurements and studies.

### What is remote identity proofing?

Identity proofing is the process of verifying that an individual is who they say they are. 

Government agencies, financial institutions, and other organizations often require some type of “proof” before granting you access to their services. This is typically done by asking you for documentation such as a driver’s license, a passport, or your Social Security Number.

Traditionally, organizations would take a hard copy of these items while in your presence and a person would physically attest that your documents actually belong to you. These processes help organizations catch people who may be pretending to be you.

Remote identity proofing uses modern technology to streamline this process. In this study, identity-proofing software will try to determine if two images of you belong to the same person. One image will be captured from a government-issued identification that has a picture of you on it, the other from a picture you take of yourself (a “selfie”). GSA will also verify the information you provide (i.e. Social Security Number, address, phone number, etc.) and compare it to data sources to ensure that it also matches.

<h2 id="participation-requirements" class="anchor-headline">Participation Requirements</h2>

### Who is eligible to participate in study?

U.S. residents 18 years and older with a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/faqs/#what-is-a-valid-id" class="usa-link">valid government-issued identity document</a> are eligible to register for the study.

### Why wasn’t I selected to participate?

You may be ineligible to participate if:

- you are under 18 years of age;
- you do not agree to the terms and conditions of the study;
- you chose “prefer not to answer” in the required demographic questions; or
- the study has already reached the necessary number of participants from specific demographics.

### What do I need to participate in the study?

You will need:
- an email address
- a mobile phone with a camera feature;
- a phone plan associated with your name (it cannot be a virtual phone number like Google Voice, VOIP, etc.);
- a valid government-issued <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/faqs/#what-is-a-valid-id" class="usa-link">identity document</a>; and
- your Social Security Number (SSN).

### What if I don’t have a government issued identification document (ID)?
The systems and methods for remote identity proofing require an ID so without one you will not be able to participate. 

<h3 id="what-is-a-valid-id" class="anchor-headline">What is a valid ID?</h3> 

A valid ID is an unexpired government-issued identification card with a photo. 

At this time, only the following IDs are accepted: 
- Driver’s licenses from the 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and other US territories (Guam, US Virgin Islands, Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico)
- Non-driver’s license state-issued ID card: This is an identity document issued by the state, the District of Columbia (DC), or US territory that asserts identity but does not give driving privileges.

<strong>Notes:</strong>
- Paper or temporary IDs are not accepted.
- A worn or damaged picture may prevent the identity verification process from working.

### What if my current address is different from the address on my ID?
Your address is verified against consumer records which typically include both current and previous addresses. If needed, you will be able to update your address during the study. 

### Why do I need to provide my Social Security Number (SSN)?
Your SSN is used to verify your name, date of birth, and address against different records such as credit history reports.

### Why do I need to provide my phone number?
Your phone number is used to look up your phone account information and verify that the name and address provided by the telephone carrier matches the information you provided.

<strong>Note:</strong> You need to provide a U.S. based phone number. You may use either a land-line or a mobile number. You cannot use a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) phone number (i.e. Google Voice).

### How much time do I need to complete the study?

Generally, the study should take <strong>15 to 45 minutes</strong>.

### How does the study work?

<ol class="list-spacing">
	<li>First, <a class="usa-link usa-link--external" href="https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_1XEHtWHnWUp2LoG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register for the study</a> . As part of registration, you will be expected to:
		<ul class="solid-bullet-list">
			<li>Review the Rules of Use &amp; Privacy Act Statement, and accept the terms and conditions.</li>
			<li>Provide your first and last name and email address.</li>
			<li>You’ll then receive an email from <a href="mailto:identityequitystudy@research.gsa.gov">identityequitystudy@research.gsa.gov</a> with a link to proceed with the study.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When you click on the link provided in the email, you will be directed to complete a demographic survey to determine whether you are eligible to participate. If so, you may proceed with the proofing process. If you are not eligible to participate, you will be notified and the information you provided up till then will be deleted.</li>
	<li>If you are eligible for the study, you will need to provide the following information:
		<ul class="solid-bullet-list">
			<li>A valid government-issued identification (e.g., driver’s license, state ID)</li>
			<li>Your Social Security Number (SSN)</li>
			<li>Your phone number</li>
		</ul>	
	</li>
	<li>During this study, you will walk through these steps for identity proofing:
		<ul class="solid-bullet-list">
			<li><strong>Document Authentication:</strong> You will capture images of your government-issued identification document (ID) and a selfie. Because you are testing FIVE different authentication systems, you will be asked to take a picture of your ID, and take a selfie, FIVE TIMES (once for each system). The pictures of your ID will check for fraud-prevention markings like holograms, as well as the expiration date and barcode. The selfies help ensure that you are the same person that is pictured on your ID.</li>
			<li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Validation:</strong> You will provide your phone number and SSN and confirm your first and last name, date of birth, and address. These items will be used to validate your personal information against consumer records like credit history and your phone account record.</li>
			<li><strong>Device Risk Check:</strong> The website scans your mobile device’s features and capabilities.</li>
			<li><strong>Security Code Check:</strong> You will receive and confirm a security code on your device (by phone call or text message).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>You will be directed to fill a short Exit Survey that is mandatory for study completion.</li>
	<li>You will receive an email with details regarding compensation.</li>
</ol>

### Why do I have to submit my information, e.g., selfie, picture of my identity document multiple times?

GSA is testing different systems that compare your selfie to your government ID picture. These systems also try to prove that you are a real person. To do this, the systems analyze the process of taking the picture to ensure that you’re not a robot. Each system needs you to actually take the photos, instead of just reusing existing photos.

### Why aren’t my pictures working?

<strong>Pictures of your government-issued ID:</strong> During this study, you will be asked for at least five pictures of the front and back of your government-issued identification. Some of the ID verification tools will take the pictures automatically, and for others, you will have to take the picture yourself. The following tips will help you take better pictures: 
- Use a solid, dark background;
- Show the edges of the ID in the photo;
- Take a clear photo without shadows, glares, reflections or blur;
- Check that barcodes are not damaged or dirty;
- Take the photo in a well lit area with indirect light;
- Turn off the flash on the camera.


<strong>Selfies:</strong> You will also be asked for at least five selfies. Again, some of these will be taken automatically, and for others, you will have to take the picture yourself. The following tips will help you take better pictures:
- Use a solid background. For example, avoid standing in front of a television if it’s turned on, because of the moving images in the background. However, if you turn the TV off, the solid dark background will likely work well;
- Look straight at the camera; 
- Take the photo in a well-lit area with indirect light;
- Turn off the flash on the camera.

### Why are you asking for my skin tone?

Research on facial verification systems has shown that results can vary significantly depending on a person’s skin tone. Although you are not required to provide your skin tone to complete the study, this information will help GSA better understand the challenges to equitable performance of facial verification algorithms.

### Since the study checks consumer history records, will participating in the study affect my credit score?

No. The vendors providing identity verification services use their own models and do not request your records from the credit bureaus. Therefore, participating in the study will not impact/affect a participant’s credit score.

### Can I participate in the study if I use a screen reader or other assistive technologies?

GSA recognizes that the “Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing'' may not be accessible to all potential participants with disabilities because it requires participants  to take photographs of their government-issued ID as well as a live “selfie” or headshot using functionality that may not be native to their device. GSA is investigating other remote identity proofing solutions that are designed to be more accessible and still compliant with the requirements in <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63-3.html&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1684362429451645&usg=AOvVaw1wt9uKCbGiyM5C-PHZoMSZ" class="usa-link usa-link--external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-63</a>. 

### I encountered an error while doing the study. What should I do?

If you see an error screen at any point you can restart the study by:

- refreshing your browser 
- clicking the link in the registration email from <a class="usa-link" href="mailto:identityequitystudy@research.gsa.gov">identityequitystudy@research.gsa.gov</a>.

Both of these methods will take you back to the start of the identity proofing tests so you will have to resubmit your pictures and information. 

If you are “stuck” in a loading page or a blank screen, we recommend switching to a different device or internet connection and then restarting the study by following the steps above.

### How are you protecting my information? 

GSA has contracts with multiple vendors contracted to perform identity proofing services for this study. GSA performs stringent data security and privacy reviews on each vendor to ensure that your data is only used for this research study. These vendors will collect, process, and transmit identity-proofing data and results to GSA. Your information will then be deleted from the vendors’ systems within 24 hours of transmission to GSA. 

After transmission from the vendors, your data is stored using secure GSA systems. These systems also undergo strict internal data and privacy reviews. Only a restricted set of GSA personnel will be able to access your information should it be required. 

Please read the study’s <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/privacy-act-statement/" class="usa-link">Privacy Act Statement</a> and <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/privacy-impact-assessments-pia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link usa-link--external">Privacy Impact Assessment</a> for more details on how your data is collected, used, and secured.

### What will you do with the information that I provided during the study?

The results of your test will be used to assess the impact of demographic factors on the identity-proofing software’s ability to successfully pass or fail an individual. These results will be aggregated, analyzed, and published in an academic journal. All information in the public report will be de-identified: your name, address, and other personal information will not be shared. 

GSA will store your data according to the retention schedule for <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/rcs/schedules/independent-agencies/rg-0269/daa-0269-2016-0013_sf115.pdf" class="usa-link usa-link--external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Customer Research and Reporting Records [PDF, 8 Pages]</a> and any other applicable federal records schedules; this requires that certain records related to research studies be destroyed six (6) years after the end of the fiscal year in which the information was collected.

### What happens to my information if I start the study but do not complete it?

If you do not complete the study, your information will be deleted and not included in the study findings.

### Am I required to include a redacted image in the publication? What is a redacted image?

You are not required to provide your redacted image for the publication. It is optional. A redacted image is an image with sensitive information blacked out. 

See example: 

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/redacted-image-id.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="A driver's license with sensitive information blacked out" width="500" height="317" class="img-fluid max-400" />
