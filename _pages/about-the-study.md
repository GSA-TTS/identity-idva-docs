The Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the participating identity-proofing vendors. This study will help assess the impacts of facial verification technology across demographic groups and vulnerable populations, which will inform the agency’s strategy and policy related to these types of technologies. GSA is working to ensure we have 4,000 participants from varied demographic backgrounds. GSA aims to understand how to improve the way we prove people’s identities remotely. Help shape the future of government technology. <a id="cta-about" href="{{ site.survey_link }}" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="usa-link usa-link--external">Join our study!</a>
