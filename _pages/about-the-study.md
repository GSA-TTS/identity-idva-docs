The Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the participating identity-proofing vendors. The study will test how one-to-one (1:1) remote identity-proofing methods like facial-verification technology perform across various demographics to determine if vendor identity verification capabilities meet equity standards across various demographics. This study will enable GSA to make a data-driven decision on whether to pursue facial verification capabilities, to determine baseline performance metrics, and to provide real-world identity verification pass rate data to the broader Federal community.

GSA made the decision not to use facial recognition, liveness detection, or similar emerging technology in connection with its identity verification service. This study will help assess the impacts of facial recognition across demographic groups and vulnerable populations, which will inform the agency’s strategy and policy related to these types of technologies. This equity study will likely launch some time in May and GSA is working to ensure we have 4000 participants from varied demographic backgrounds. In the end, we hope to understand how to improve the way we prove people’s identities remotely.
