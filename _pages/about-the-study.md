The Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the participating identity-proofing vendors. The study will test how one-to-one (1:1) remote identity-proofing methods like facial-verification technology perform across various demographics to determine if vendor identity verification capabilities meet equity standards across various demographics. This study will enable GSA to make a data-driven decision on whether to pursue facial verification capabilities, to determine baseline performance metrics, and to provide real-world identity verification pass rate data to the broader Federal community.
