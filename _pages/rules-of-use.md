The Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the participating identity-proofing vendors. The study will test how one-to-one (1:1) remote identity-proofing methods like facial-verification technology perform across various demographics to determine if vendor identity verification capabilities meet equity standards across various demographics. This study will enable GSA to make a data-driven decision on whether to pursue facial verification capabilities, to determine baseline performance metrics, and to provide real-world identity verification pass rate data to the broader Federal community. GSA will collect Personally Identifying Information (PII) during this study to verify your identity. This will include comparing a photo of your government-issued ID with a live photograph of your face (a “selfie”). GSA will also collect demographic information from you.

These Rules of Use provide:

- Information on the Equity Study process and what you can expect from it,
- The terms under which you participate in the Equity Study,
- How GSA and its partners will use your information and your rights to that information, and
- The conditions that you agree to when you participate in the Equity Study.
