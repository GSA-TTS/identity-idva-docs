# How to Participate
The Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the participating identity-proofing vendors. 

To participate in this Study, you will need:

1.  A mobile phone - The study is mobile only. If you start the study on your desktop or laptop, you will be directed to continue the study on a mobile phone. 

2.  Your state-issued ID, Driver's License - Document authentication is done as a part of Remote Identity Proofing. A physical card is required. You will be required to take images of the front and the back of your ID, as directed, during the study and will be asked to take a selfie as well for liveness check.

3.  Your Social Security Number - A physical card is not required. The SSN you provide when prompted will be used to validate your PII.

4.  A phone number on a phone plan associated with your name - It should be a U.S. number and not be a virtual phone such as Google Voice or Skype. You do not need to be the primary account holder. The phone number will be used to verify your identity by checking it against your bill records and to perform multi-factor authentication.
