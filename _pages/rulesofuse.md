# Rules of Use
The Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and the participating identity-proofing vendors. The study will test how one-to-one (1:1) remote identity-proofing methods like facial-verification technology perform across various demographics to determine if vendor identity verification capabilities meet equity standards across various demographics. This study will enable GSA to make a data-driven decision on whether to pursue facial verification capabilities, to determine baseline performance metrics, and to provide real-world identity verification pass rate data to the broader Federal community. 

GSA will collect Personally Identifying Information (PII) during this study to verify your identity. This will include comparing a photo of your identity document with a live photograph of your face (a “selfie”). GSA will also collect demographic information from you.
These Rules of Use provide:
Information on the Equity Study process and what you can expect from it,
The terms under which you participate in the Equity Study,
How GSA and its partners will use your information and your rights to that information, and
The conditions that you agree to when you participate in the Equity Study.

Prior to participating in the Equity Study, you are required to agree to these Rules of Use.

<b>1.Your Agreement</b>
By accepting these Rules of Use, you agree to participate in a study that will test the software of multiple Identity Proofing vendors. Specifically, this Equity Study will test the performance of document authentication, biometric comparison (comparing your selfie to the picture in your identity document), and liveness detection of the participating vendors. In addition, the study will assess vendor performance on the non-biometric aspects of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-63-3 guidelines for remote identity proofing. This will allow for a more informed comparison of drop-off rates, i.e., to what extent a successful or unsuccessful identity verification is caused by either biometric or non-biometric aspects of the process.

You agree that:

- You are not a person under 18 years of age,
- Any information you provide to us is complete and accurate,
- The identity you claim when participating in the study is your own, and
- You will comply with applicable local, state, and federal laws during the study.

You further agree that you will NOT misrepresent your identity or any information you present in the Equity Study, including through participant support channels.

We will post any changes to these Rules of Use to URL. If the changes affect our handling of your personal information or are otherwise deemed significant, we will notify you by email. If we cannot reach you by email, we reserve the right to contact you by other means, including postal mail. If at any time prior to the completion of the study should you no longer agree to these Rules of Use, Privacy Act Statement, Consent Forms, Privacy Impact Assessment, or SORN, you may contact us at identityequitystudy@gsa.gov or (202) 969-0772.

GSA will share a de-identified dataset containing aggregated demographic and identity-verification results with Clarkson University’s Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) who will analyze the results and assist GSA in producing a peer-reviewed publication. To explain proofing failures, this publication (with your consent) may include images of the selfies and profile pictures from your identity document (any other PII in your identity document will be redacted). 

As stated above, this publication will assist GSA in making more informed decisions regarding identity-verification capabilities. The outcome will also enable GSA to provide more equitable access to diverse populations that need to prove their identity to obtain government services.
## Recruitment Service
GSA will be working with Rekrewt, a recruitment partner, to engage up to 4,000 participants residing in the US and US territories to participate in the study. Rekrewt will post advertisements in social media and assist GSA with building different outreach materials. Rekrewt will also manage participants’ compensation. To track compensation and ensure GSA meets the study’s demographic needs, Rekrewt will receive your name and email address along with an aggregated and de-identified demographic quota status.
## Survey Administration
GSA will use a licensed survey software, Qualtrics, to send you a survey asking for your demographic information (race, ethnicity, gender, age, income, and educational level). This information will help GSA understand if and how demographics impact the identity-proofing results of various remote identity-proofing solutions. Survey responses are stored in the Qualtrics system for the purposes of managing quota requirements. GSA will also store the survey responses in a GSA licensed Google Drive to maintain a history of interested participants and correlate the demographic data with the identity-proofing results. The system generates a unique ID that is used to track completion status. Upon completion of all study requirements, GSA will provide your name and email address to Rekrewt to complete the compensation process.
## Device Risk Information Collection
While you are using the study’s web-based platform, GSA will collect hardware and software data as well as device-behavioral information (how you use the device and its applications) for device risk detection from the personal mobile device you use to complete the study.  
## Vendor Performance of Identity Proofing Document Authentication and PII Validation
If eligible, you will also help GSA test multiple vendors’ document authentication software. You will go through an identity-proofing workflow that includes document authentication and PII validation.

The identity-proofing workflow collects the following personally identifiable information (PII): 
- a picture of your identity document and attributes printed on the document, 
- a picture of your face, and
- your Full Name, Social Security Number, Date of Birth, Phone Number, and Physical Address

GSA will direct all identity-proofing vendors to delete your data from their systems within 24 hours of collection. GSA will retain records of this study in accordance with GSA's retention schedule for <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/rcs/schedules/independent-agencies/rg-0269/daa-0269-2016-0013_sf115.pdf" target="_blank">Customer Research and Reporting Records</a>  and any other applicable federal records schedules.

During document validation, you will provide information to GSA’s vendors so they may provide identity-verification services to GSA. Specifically, GSA will present unbranded capture screens for the identity-proofing vendors. Each vendor will collect information from you during the presentation of their designated screens, including a selfie, and validate the provided data. Vendors will transmit their results to GSA, and GSA will store those results on the GSA Google Drive.

During PII validation, you will provide information directly to GSA. GSA then shares that information with the applicable vendors for verification.

The final step is a security code check that ensures the device you used in the workflow is in your possession and owned by you. 

<b>All data collected by the identity-proofing vendors shall be deleted within 24 hours of the transaction with each vendor</b>. PII deletion from vendors’ systems is achieved by different mechanisms, and ensured through a contractual requirement.
## Exit Survey
After the last step in the Equity Study, you will be redirected to a GSA-administered Qualtrics exit survey. The purpose of the exit survey is to gather usability feedback with the study. A copy of the exit survey results will be stored in the GSA Google Drive and Qualtrics. 
## Termination
Participation in the Equity Study is voluntary. If you do not consent to the Equity Study, you may not participate and no information beyond what was collected during recruitment will be collected. Once your information is submitted at the conclusion of the exit survey, you may no longer terminate your participation. In any event, we will still protect your personal information consistent with our Privacy Act Statement and System of Record Notice.

Information collected through the Equity Study will be retained subject to our <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/11/21/2022-25420/privacy-act-of-1974-notice-of-a-modified-system-of-records" target="_blank">System of Records Notice</a> , as amended. GSA will retain records of this study in accordance with GSA's retention schedule for <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/rcs/schedules/independent-agencies/rg-0269/daa-0269-2016-0013_sf115.pdf" target="_blank">Customer Research and Reporting Records</a> and any other applicable federal records schedules.
## Authorities
GSA is conducting the study pursuant to <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title6-section1523&num=0&edition=prelim" target="_blank">6 USC § 1523 (b)(1)(A)-(E)</a>  and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/M-19-17.pdf" target="_blank">OMB Memo M-19-17</a>.
## Service Operation and Customer Support
The Equity Study operates with a high standard of service, both in service delivery and customer support.

<b>Availability and Uptime</b>
N/A

<b>Participant Support</b>
Participant support is available through identityequitystudy@gsa.gov or via voicemail at (202) 969-0772.  When you request participant support, we will use any information you provide to address your question or comment, and may use your feedback to improve this or future studies or for other purposes as we see fit. In doing so, we will never reveal your personal information outside of the Equity Study except as required by applicable law or as stated elsewhere in these Rules of Use.

## Responsibilities of Our Partners
Identity proofing vendors will collect data during the workflow and share results with GSA, and GSA will prohibit further access to data upon receipt. The identity-proofing vendors will delete this data within 24 hours of your identity proofing transaction. GSA will provide the Recruitment partner your email address and name for compensation purposes via Google products. All vendors are required to protect your information in compliance with federal law and policy.

In designing this study, GSA assessed each vendor, the type of data and level of access they require to render services, and all potential risks of both GSA and the vendor’s processes and applications. Based on these assessments, GSA entered agreements that minimize the data vendors receive while still accomplishing the goals of the study.
