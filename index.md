# Overview
The Equity Study on Remote Identity Proofing is administered by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA)
and the participating identity-proofing vendors. The study will test how one-to-one (1:1) remote
identity-proofing methods like facial-verification technology perform across various demographics to determine
if vendor identity verification capabilities meet equity standards across various demographics. This study will
enable GSA to make a data-driven decision on whether to pursue facial verification capabilities, to determine
baseline performance metrics, and to provide real-world identity verification pass rate data to the broader
Federal community. To register to participate in this study, click <a href="https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_1XEHtWHnWUp2LoG" target="_blank">here</a>.
